Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil.

Beat egg with 2 teaspoons water and a large pinch salt and add to skillet. Cook, stirring to form large soft curds, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. 

Return skillet to high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil, the carrots, and whites of the spring onions. Cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.

Add rice, peas, and cooked eggs to skillet. Pour in soy sauce and cook, stirring until heated through, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the remaining spring onions.
